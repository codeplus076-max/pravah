1. Executive Summary 
PropSight NM is an AI-driven house price prediction platform purpose-built for the Navi Mumbai real 
estate market. By aggregating historical transaction data, micro-location intelligence, infrastructure 
developments, and macroeconomic signals, the platform delivers accurate, explainable property 
valuations for buyers, sellers, agents, and financial institutions. 
 
Navi Mumbai — spanning nodes such as Vashi, Kharghar, Panvel, Nerul, Airoli, and Belapur — is one 
of India's fastest-growing planned urban agglomerations. The market lacks a dedicated, data-rich 
valuation tool, creating significant friction for all stakeholders. PropSight NM addresses this gap with an 
ML-powered engine, interactive dashboards, and a developer-friendly API. 
2. Problem Statement 
2.1 Market Pain Points 
• Buyers overpay or under-negotiate due to opaque, agent-driven pricing. 
• Sellers lack objective benchmarks, leading to prolonged listing periods. 
• Banks and NBFCs rely on manual, subjective appraisals for home loans — slow and error-
prone. 
• Real estate agents have no standardised tool for quick comparative market analysis (CMA). 
• Existing pan-India platforms (99acres, MagicBricks) provide only aggregated data — no Navi 
Mumbai-specific depth. 
 
2.2 Opportunity

Navi Mumbai saw over 42,000 residential registrations in 2023–24 (MahaRERA data), with a CAGR of 
~11% in average property values over the last 5 years. Significant catalysts — Navi Mumbai 
International Airport (NMIA), Navi Mumbai Metro Line 1, and Mumbai Trans-Harbour Link (MTHL) — 
are actively reshaping micro-market valuations, creating an urgent need for a dynamic, forward-looking 
prediction engine. 
3. Goals & Objectives 
3.1 Product Goals 
1. Deliver price predictions with ≤8% Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for residential 
properties. 
2. Provide instant valuations (<3 seconds) for any residential unit in Navi Mumbai. 
3. Support 10,000+ daily active users (DAU) within 12 months of launch. 
4. Achieve a 4.2/5 user satisfaction score within 6 months of launch. 
 
3.2 Business Goals 
• Generate B2B revenue via API subscriptions for banks, NBFCs, and PropTech platforms. 
• Establish PropSight NM as the go-to valuation authority for Navi Mumbai within 18 months. 
• Partner with MahaRERA and IGR Maharashtra for official data integration.

comparables 
Cache 6 months of data; explore 
secondary data partnerships 
NMIA/Metro delay shifts 
micro-market dynamics 
unexpectedly 
Medium Model drift, 
inaccurate 
forecasts 
Monthly model retraining; add 
infrastructure delay scenarios to 
forecast model 
Regulatory changes to data 
sharing (DPDP Act 
enforcement) 
Medium Data pipeline 
redesign required 
Privacy-by-design from day 1; legal 
review of all data sources 
Competition from funded 
PropTech startups entering 
Navi Mumbai 
Medium User acquisition 
cost increase 
First-mover advantage; deepen 
CIDCO/MahaRERA partnerships; 
focus on B2B moat 
Model accuracy gap in low-
transaction micro-markets 
(e.g., Taloja) 
Low Poor UX in sparse 
zones 
Hierarchical modelling; clearly 
communicate confidence intervals to
